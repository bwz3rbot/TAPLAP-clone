Reddit Wiki System Guide

This page aims to give an overview on how Reddit's wiki system works from a perspective of both users and moderators. Each heading will describe a feature and feature individual sections, one for an average user and the other for the subreddit moderator. For the purposes of this page, we will use SUB in the place of a subreddit name where appropriate.
Enabling The Wiki For Your Subreddit
User

A moderator must enable the wiki for their subreddit. Please contact the moderators of your subreddit if you wish to use the wiki system.
Moderator

To enable the wiki system, you must navigate to your 'community settings' (/r/SUB/about/edit/) and look for the 'wiki' heading. From there, you have three options:

    disabled This is the default option.
    mod editing This option allows moderators to create and edit pages. In addition to this, each page has their own individual settings where a moderator can allow other users to edit pages (which will be covered later on this page).
    anyone This setting allows any user to create and edit wiki pages. This setting as two additional options:
        Subreddit karma required to edit and create wiki pages This is the minimum of total karma (gained in your subreddit) required to create or modify a wiki page. The default is 0, which allows anyone access. This number takes into account the maximum of either comment or submission karma in your subreddit.
        Account age (days) required to edit and create wiki pages This is the minimum account age that is allowed to edit or create wiki pages. The default is 0.

How to edit an existing wiki page

To edit an existing wiki page, just click the edit button right there on the page. The editing box supports the standard markdown syntax used for commenting, so bolding, headings, lists, tables and so on can be used, just as they can be used in regular reddit comments.

Once you click Save, your edits will be committed.
How to make a new wiki page

To make a new wiki page, try and navigate to the page - that is, enter the URL of the intended page into the browser's address bar. For example, to create a page called "help" in the "meta" category, try and access this address:

http://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITNAME/wiki/meta/help

If the page does not exist, and you have sufficient permissions, you'll see a "create page" link on the resulting "page not found" screen. Click the "create page" link and the editing screen will be displayed. Once you click Save, the page will be created.

Note: if you want to create a page outside a category (eg. at the top level of the wiki), the above applies - just leave out the category in the URL. So, for example, to create a top-level page called "index", use this address:

http://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITNAME/wiki/index

How to make a new category

If you'd like to make a folder in the wiki, which is to contain other pages, simply create the subpages. The category will be created automatically. So, for example, to make categories called "exampleA", "exampleB", "exampleC", with subpages "pageX", "pageY", and "pageZ" respectively, use the "create page" link on the following URLs:

http://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITNAME/wiki/exampleA/pageX
http://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITNAME/wiki/exampleB/pageY
http://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITNAME/wiki/exampleC/pageZ

Note: a "category page" is not automatically created by reddit. To continue with the above example, making a page called "pageY" in the "exampleB" category does not automatically create a page called "exampleB". This can be created manually, if desired, using the URL:

http://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDITNAME/wiki/exampleB

If this is done, the category page will adopt all the subpages in that category, so that in the "all pages" listing, the category page is listed first, with its subpages listed underneath.
How to add a table of contents

The "table of contents" is the menu at the top-right of the page, listing each heading in the page. This table is created automatically by reddit. To list a section of the page in the table of contents, simply give it a heading, using the standard heading markdown syntax such as ###.
