## About <a name = "about"></a>

This Reddit bot will generate a user directory wiki for your subreddit. It will follow a defined command thread which allows users to rate other users they have had interactions with. Users may use the command `!rate u/bwz3r 5 stars` to give u/bwz3r a 5 star rating!\
Further instructions on how to format commands are defined below, and will be auto-generated in your wiki upon running the wikiInitializer script.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The first step if you have not done so yet is to enable the wiki for your subreddit.\
To enable the wiki system, navigate to 'community settings' (https://reddit.com/r/SUB/about/edit/) and select the 'wiki' heading.\
Click the dropdown and select 'mods only' to allow mods to edit the pages.\
Once your bot account is configred, you'll have to give it mod access to edit these pages.\
It will also need mod access to set the selected sort of a command thread to new.\
Be sure that Karma and Age of Reddit account fields are also set to 0.


Make sure you have the correct version of NodeJS for your system. You can find the download here (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Instructions on installing node on a raspberry pi can be found here: (https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-raspberry-pi/).


Also install MongoDB as this bot requires a database to function. Instructions for windows, mac and raspberry pi 4 can be found here: https://diyprojects.io/mongodb-part-1-installation-windows-macos-raspberry-pi/

Instructions for downloading mongodb on a Raspberry Pi 3 Here: https://andyfelong.com/2019/03/mongodb-4-0-6-64-bit-on-raspberry-pi-3/

<b>This project has been tested to work on a Windows Machine.</b>

You'll have to create a new account for your bot before you move any further.\
And you'll have to grant the account permissions on your subreddit.\
Once the account is created, log in, go to this url(reddit.com/prefs/apps), and fill out the form to create a new script app.

### Installing
Now that you've set up your bot account, granted it permissions on your subreddit, and created a script app, it's time to download the source code and paste in your environment variables.

Download the .zip file containing the source code on this page. Unzip it and save it to your computer somewhere. Now open up the pw.envEXAMPLE file.\
Also have open reddit.com/prefs/apps as you'll need to copy/paste the items you'll find there.\
<strong>USER_AGENT</strong> is just a name that the server will identify your bot by. It can be whatever you want.\
<strong>CLIENT_ID</strong> and <strong>CLIENT_SECRET</strong> are fround in prefs/apps.\
<strong>REDDIT_USER</strong> is your bots username.\
<strong>REDDIT_PASS</strong> is its password.\
<strong>MASTER_SUB</strong> is the subreddit it will work on.\
<strong>LIMIT</strong> will cause the bot to check this many items per sweep. It takes a bit longer to start up, but can accomodate for more requests the higher you set it with a maximum of 25. Setting this value higher will ensure that when stopping and restarting the bot, no requests are forgotten.\
<strong>DEBUG_CODE</strong> and <strong>DEBUG_NETWORK</strong> should be set to false unless any problems arise.\
<strong>WIKI_WELCOME_MESSAGE</strong> will be displayed in the top of your generated wiki index page.\
<strong>THREAD_ID</strong> You will have to go into your subreddit and create a new thread. I suggest pinning it so that users can see it and easily use it. Once it is created you'll have to copy and paste the id from the url bar into this field. The bot works by latching onto this thread and setting suggested sort to new, then continously streaming in the latest requests and handling them in a queue. This field is definately required before starting your bot. It may be changed at any time if you decide to start a new command thread.\
See the below example of a url. The id will be used in the pw.envEXAMPLE file as a reference. Copy the id from the thread you create just like this one:
```
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bwz3rBot/comments/ja6v32/bot_command_thread/
```





    USER_AGENT=''
    CLIENT_ID=''
    CLIENT_SECRET=''
    REDDIT_USER=''
    REDDIT_PASS=''
    MASTER_SUB=''
    LIMIT='9'
    DEBUG_CODE="false"
    DEBUG_NETWORK="true"
    WIKI_WELCOME_MESSAGE="ðŸŒ¿Welcome to The Greenhouse"
    THREAD_ID="ja6v32"
    


Once these fields are completely filled out, remove <i>EXAMPLE</i> from the end of the filename.

> pw.envEXAMPLE = pw.env

Once you've got your pw.env file correctly filled out and renamed, you may run the installer script to prepare your environment.\
Before beginning this final step, be sure your bot account is granted admin rights on your subreddit.\
Also be sure the wiki is enabled for your subreddit and admins have write access.\
And finally, be absoultely sure that you have created a thread for your bot to latch onto and set it correctly to THREAD_ID in pw.env\
Now run the wikiInit script to initialize your wiki pages.\
This script will generate an index page at /r/YourSub/wiki/userdirectory/\
It will run until its created all pages for the directory, A-Z and an etc for users with - or _ in their names.\
If anything goes wrong during the installation or you wish to start fresh, you may run it again. All data will be wiped clean from the wiki. You will be left with a fresh index page and generated wiki pages A-Z & etc.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

 Be sure that you've set up your pw.env file correctly and have run the installer and wikiInit scripts before running the bot. Also run the mongo script to start your database server. Running this script will start mongodb in the correct directory for the bot to find the files.

 Always have mongo running before starting run script.

 To start the bot use the run script.

 It will watch the thread you set in THREAD_ID for commands as explained in the generated wiki.

 ## Backing Up Your Data <a name = "backup"></a>

It's strongly recommended that you back up your database! That is where all your user data is stored and if anything happens to it, its not going to be a good time for your subreddit. Luckily it's very easy to just copy the database directory from the folder and keep it somewhere safe. If anything happens to your bot's database, just delete the corrupt one and paste in the backup. It should all work out just fine. Any questions or comments can be sent to (https://reddit.com/u/bwz3r)

 ## Here's an example of how your Wiki should look: <a name = "example"></a>

<h1>How to use this bot?</h1>

Users may submit reviews to this [bot command thread](/r/Bwz3rBot/comments/jaha01).

Commands must be formated with a directive of `!rate`. The first command argument must be the name of the user to be updated. The second argument must be a rating number between 1 and 5 followed by the word stars. The next arg must be the type of interaction. Was it either (a. sale, b. trade, c. giveaway)? If no type is specified, it defaults to a sale. All arguments following interaction type will be converted to a string, and will go into the comments section of the review. Command MUST contain an interaction type of you wish to include a comment.

`!rate u/Bwz3r 5 stars sale We had a great interaction! I'm rating u/Bwz3r 5 stars!`

This command will be processed by the bot and will find u/Bwz3r within the database. If the user does not exist within the database, the user will be added to the list of reviewed users and will retain the rating given along with any comments, and a link to the command comment. Any future ratings received by this user will be added to their file and any changes made will be instantly updated in the user directory under their alphabetized page. Users scores will be averaged according to number of reviews / scores rounded down. Stars will be awarded each user according to their calculated average rating. Any questions or errors found while using the bot can be submitted to u/Bwz3r. Thank you for reading!
